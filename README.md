# 📸 Image Authentication using Histogram Shifting and Arnold's Cat Map

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an approach for Image Authentication based on the Histogram Shifting Method using Arnold's Cat Map. The primary objective is to embed a watermark in images securely, ensuring their authenticity and integrity, which is especially useful for medical images. 🏥🔒

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Watermark Embedding & Extraction**: Secure image authentication through reversible data hiding.
- 🎨 **Histogram Shifting Technique**: Ensures imperceptible watermarking without significant image degradation.
- 🌀 **Arnold's Cat Map**: Used for scrambling the watermark for enhanced security.
- 📊 **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC).
- 🛡️ **Attack Resistance**: Resilient to image processing attacks like histogram equalization, median filtering, Gaussian noise, salt & pepper noise, cropping, JPEG compression, etc.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Embedding Process
1. 🖼️ Convert the image using Haar Wavelet Transform.
2. 🔍 Divide the image into LL, HL, LH, and HH sub-bands.
3. 🔄 Apply Arnold's Cat Map to scramble the watermark image.
4. 🔑 Encode the watermark using SHA-256 hashing.
5. 📥 Embed the scrambled watermark into the HH sub-band and the SHA-256 hash into LL sub-band using Histogram Shifting.
6. 🔄 Perform Inverse Haar Transform to reconstruct the stego image.

### 2️⃣ Extraction Process
1. 🔄 Apply Haar Transform on the stego image to extract LL and HH components.
2. 🖼️ Retrieve the watermark from HH sub-band and extract the SHA-256 hash from LL sub-band.
3. 🔄 Reverse Arnold's Cat Map to recover the original watermark.
4. ✅ Verify watermark integrity using SHA-256 validation.

## 📊 Experimental Results
- 📂 **Dataset Used**: USC SIPI Image Dataset
- 📈 **Average PSNR**: 60.866 dB
- 🔢 **NCC after Salt & Pepper Noise (0.001 density)**: 0.89
- 🛡️ **Performance**: Image authentication works well under normal conditions but is affected by aggressive attacks.

## 📦 Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python scipy

## ▶️ Usage

**Run the attack script:**  
Open the desired attack notebook (e.g., `Attack/Median Blur_3/Average Filtering.ipynb`) and run all cells to apply the attack on the images.

**Run the extraction script:**  
Open the `Without Attack/code no attacks.ipynb` notebook and run all cells to extract the watermark from the attacked images.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project successfully implements a robust image authentication technique using **Histogram Shifting** and **Arnold's Cat Map**.  
The method is effective for secure watermark embedding, but its **resilience against aggressive attacks can be improved**.
